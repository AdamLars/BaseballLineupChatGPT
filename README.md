## Summary

This project contains a basic UI to allow a user to input triple slash lines for a baseball team and then it will ask OpenAI for the best batting order using those lineups.

## Note

The 'src' folder contains all the components of the application. Inside of this folder there is an 'App' folder which contains all images and code used in this application. It is important to note that this project makes calls to OpenAI using an API key that costs money to maintain. Please get your own API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and place it in the .txt file in App called "APIkey.txt".
